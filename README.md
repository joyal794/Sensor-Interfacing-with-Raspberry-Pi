## Instructions
1.Connect the Pi SenseHAT to the RaspBerryPi \
2.Connect to the Raspberry Pi using SSH \
3.Upload the code to the Pi using scp command \
4.Run the code to get the output 
## Conclusion
This lab focused on sensor interfacing using the Raspberry Pi 5 and Sense HAT. The primary goals were to control the LED matrix to display messages and retrieve real-time environmental data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) using Python. These tasks are foundational for embedded AI and robotics applications.
